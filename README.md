# python_basics
Aimed basically to be used by anyone who wants to learn or is a beginner in Python. The files are mostly jupyter notebooks which I worked on while taking BIOL 890 (Data Science for Biologists) under Dr. Brad Olson. There are also some jupyter notebooks which I have created in tutorial formats. I will keep this repo updated time permitting. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. 

Hoping this will help someone during their initial steps towards Python and Bioinformatics.
