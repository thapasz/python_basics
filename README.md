# python_basics

This is a collection of my Jyputer scrapbook. 

Here I have some jupyter notebooks which have been created over the years with the help of the courses I have taken as well as YouTube videos and Coursera based learning. I will keep this repo updated as I go. Hoping this will help someone during their initial steps towards Python programming and Bioinformatics!! 

Aimed basically for anyone who wants to learn and/or is a beginner in Python programming.  

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me.
