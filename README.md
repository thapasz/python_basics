# python_basics
Aimed basically for anyone who wants to learn and/or is a beginner in Python programming.  

I have here some jupyter notebooks which I have created like notes to self with the help of classes I have taken and overall simple programming that I have learnt over the years. I will keep this repo updated, time permitting. Hoping this will help someone during their initial steps towards Python and Bioinformatics!!!

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me.
